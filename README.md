# tooling-till-i-drop

My toolbox, if you will...

# Overview

Tools help us automate annoying things that take up our day.

They also reduce the chance of user error.

However, they must also be updated regularily to be of use.

Additionally, some tools are so specific to a use case that they might even be used only once or twice!

However, with the forging of each tool, the inventor gets better. 

And hopefully, more clever..


# Tools I am actively maintaining (repo links):


- [Test Ad Repo](https://github.com/foreza/SESUPPLY-TESTADS) A repo for storing test ads. I use this as a makeshift CDN since I can't be bothered to upload it elsewhere and this keeps it versioned. For example, https://jasonthechiu.com/SESUPPLY-TESTADS/ias-test-dog-vast 
- [Grabba (the hut)](https://github.com/foreza/im-grabbathehut) A simple tool that grabs out the Ad XML from InMobi's video ad responses. Extremely niche, extremely time saving. 



# External Tools I use:

- [IMA SDK validator](https://googleads.github.io/googleads-ima-html5/vsi/) For debugging ad payloads. Rule of thumb.. if it works here, it's fair game on any service I use!
- [JSON Escape/Unescape](https://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html) When I'm given a payload and I just want to quickly do stuff to it, but need to escape/unescape. Looking for an ad-free version (TODO: build my own)
- [Remove line breaks](https://www.textfixer.com/tools/remove-line-breaks.php) I must confess, this is actually not the one I use frequently but this is one of the ones I've used. And yeah, I should.. (TODO: build my own)
